# Arduino Wiegand Decoder for HID RFID Reader
I wrote this Arduino sketch as a follow-up to my PIC Wiegand decoder. That article goes into a lot more detail about the Wiegand protocol and how it works. However, it was one of my first microcontroller projects. The code wasn't great and the hardware was a custom PIC18 development board. If you're starting from scratch, it wouldn't be particularly easy to re-implement that code. So, I made a Wiegand decoder using the Arduino, since it's a very popular development platform.
